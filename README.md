# Summary
Wastes CPU and RAM just for fun.
You control how much RAM and how many threads in CPU to waste.

# Input
Each time you're asked to enter one of the following numbers:
  - 0\. Exit
  - 1\. Waste CPU
  - 2\. Waste RAM
Entering 1 stops currently running threads and asks how many new threads to create.
Entering 2 clears currently allocated memory and asks how any MBs to allocate next.

# Tip
64-bit build works better!
